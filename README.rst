Life, the Universe, and Everything
----------------------------------

This package includes a content type, views and viewlets to represent a blog
inside a Plone site.

Posts are represented by instances of News Articles as defined in the
`collective.nitf`_ package.

Don't Panic
-----------

Just install the package and start adding Blogs and Posts.

A blog has an associated image that is shown in a viewlet located below the
breadcrumb.

TODO List
---------

- Add some portlets for a Tag Cloud and the list of Posts in the Blog.

Mostly Harmless
